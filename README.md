# Credit Card Clients Clustering 
This project aims to cluster credit card clients into segments based on factors such as balance, purchase behavior, and other relevant features using various clustering algorithms including K-means, DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), and Hierarchical Clustering. Additionally, the project includes anomaly detection using GMM to identify potential outliers within the dataset.

Features
1. Data Preprocessing
- Data Cleaning: Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
2. Clustering
- K-means Clustering: Cluster credit card clients using the K-means algorithm to group similar clients based on their features.

- DBSCAN Clustering: Utilize Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to cluster clients based on their spatial density, allowing for flexible cluster shapes.

- Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM): Apply GMM to model the distribution of the data as a mixture of Gaussian distributions, enabling probabilistic clustering.

- Hierarchical Clustering: Perform hierarchical clustering to group clients based on the similarity of their features in a hierarchical manner.

3. Anomaly Detection
- Outlier Detection: Implement anomaly detection techniques using GMM to identify potential outliers or anomalies within the dataset.
